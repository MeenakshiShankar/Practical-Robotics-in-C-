# Practical Robotics in C++
Build and program real autonomous robots using Raspberry Pi
 
This is the code repository for [Practical Robotics in C++](https://bpbonline.com/products/practical-robotics-in-c?_pos=1&_sid=a321c5f2b&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the journey of this book

## About the Book
Practical Robotics in C++ teaches the complete spectrum of Robotics, right from the setting up a computer for a robot controller to putting power to the wheel motors. The book brings you the workshop knowledge of the electronics, hardware, and software for building a mobile robot platform. 

You will learn to use sensors to detect obstacles, training your robot to build itself a map and plan an obstacle-avoiding path, how to structure your code for modularity and interchangeability with other robot projects. Throughout the book, you can experience the demonstrations of  complete coding of robotics with the use of simple and clear C++ programming.

In addition, you will explore how to leverage the Raspberry Pi GPIO hardware interface pins and existing libraries to make an incredibly capable machine on the most affordable computer platform ever.

## What you will learn
* Write code for the motor drive controller
* Build a Map from Lidar Data 
* Write and implement our autonomous path-planning algorithm
* Write code to send path waypoints to the motor drive controller autonomously
* Get to know more about Robot mapping and navigation
